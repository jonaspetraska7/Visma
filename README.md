# Visma Task
### Prerequisites
* Microsoft Visual Studio with support for the newest stable version of .NET (currently .NET6).
* Microsoft SQL Server.
* Preparation - Create a database in your MSSQL server called VismaDb.
### Launch
* Standard - Open the Visma.sln solution select Visma launch profile in Visual Studio and launch the project.

# Decisions made / Performace considerations
### Linq2db 
* Using Linq2db lightweight ORM instead of Entity framework  for more performant DB operations 

### Common
* All bussiness and persistance layer logic moved to a Common class library, so that the solution is not tied to the implementing project (Could make a Winforms/MVC or any other type of app, not only API if needed)
